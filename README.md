# techmodpack
just some configs n stuff (no mods included)

## NOTE
1. For optimal speed (LWJGL 3) and an updated Java version (only Java 21), it is recommended to utilize [CleanroomMC's Loader](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Cleanroom).
2. Attempt to download the Sodium Backport through [Asek3's Sodium Port](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12) and navigate to the [Actions tab (getting artifacts requires a GitHub account)](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12/actions).
3. It is advised to use some performance Java Arguments ([brucethemoose java flags](https://github.com/brucethemoose/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks) or [Mukul1127's updated version](https://github.com/Mukul1127/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks/tree/main)) with the modpack, as mentioned above (CleanroomMC's Loader). This will minimize stutters (if they occur) and speed up startup, among other benefits!

## Compatility
1. If you're curious about the modpack compatibility, it will function with some versions of the standard FML (Forge Mod Loader) that I released in this early stage before I switch to finding mods that will only function with CLeanroomMC's Loader.
